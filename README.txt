[Deprecated] Allow whitelisted REST routes to pass through [Disable REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-json-api/) filters

== Description ==

[Deprecated] Allow whitelisted REST routes to pass through [Disable REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-json-api/) filters

> [Disable REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-json-api/) now supports whitelisting of individual routes since version 1.4.
> This plugin is no longer maintained.

= Define REST route whitelist =

Define 'JAILBREAK_DRA_WHITELIST' constant in `wp-config.php`

`
define('JAILBREAK_DRA_WHITELIST', [
    '/wp/v2/posts',
    '/wp/v2/posts/1234',
    '/wp/v2/tags',
    '/wp/v2/tags/(?P<id>[\\d]+)',
]);

/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */
`

= Filters =

* `jailbreak_dra_is_whitelisted`

Example:
`
add_filter( 'jailbreak_dra_is_whitelisted', 'example_callback', 10, 3);

function example_callback(bool $isWhitelisted, string $currentRESTRoute, array $whitelist): bool {
    // Perform your checks and return a boolean
    return $isWhitelisted;
}
`

* `jailbreak_dra_whitelist`

Example:
`
add_filter( 'jailbreak_dra_whitelist', 'example_callback');

function example_callback(array $whitelist): array {
     // Modify $whitelist and return string[]
    return $whitelist;
}
`

= Do I need this plugin? =

* [Disable REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-json-api/) have planned to add whitelisting support which makes this plugin unnecessary. See [Dave McHale's comment](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/restrict-plug-in-use-of-rest-api/#post-9425207)
* If you have a legitimate need of the REST API, don't use  not need `Disable REST API` at all. See [Dave McHale's comment](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/restrict-plug-in-use-of-rest-api/#post-9367800)

= Requirements =

* PHP `7.0` or later
* WordPress `4.7` or later
